## 🌌 What’s NightReign in Elden Ring?

*NightReign* is the kinda DLC that tests your patience and your dodging skills at the same time 😤. Think darker lore, sharper bosses, and zero chill. It’s all about that corrupted moon vibe and twisted new enemies with insane movesets.

If the OG Elden Ring made you rage-quit, NightReign is gonna finish the job...

Unless you step in with a **cheat pack that turns you into a one-hit legend.**
